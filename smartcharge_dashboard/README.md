# SmartCharge Dashboard

This is the control and monitoring dashboard for the system. It is used to turn the wireless charging transmitter on/off, view the mode of operation (OFF, STANDBY, ACTIVE) and also to view the secondary side voltage and current.

It connects to the systems Firebase Realtime database, and reads/write this information from there.

The main code for the dashboard is in the lib folder.
